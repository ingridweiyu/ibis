# ibis


In this project, we introduce Ibis, a Python framework to access data and perform data analysis task from different sources. Basically, it allows users to perform SQL operations (select, join, filter, etc.) with Python syntax without loading data into memory. 

Here we perform data analysis using Ibis on club dataset as a tutorial and we use sqlite as an example back end engine.
